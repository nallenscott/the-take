`[intro]`

**NATE**: Hey LinkedIn fam! I’m Nate Allen and this is The Take for June 28, 2023.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Today we're tackling something we all love, or hate: code reviews, and in particular, that sweet, sometimes too easy 'LGTM' comment - 'Looks Good To Me.' You know, that one liner we drop when we feel like, "Yeah, it's good enough," or when we're swamped and just want to move things along. But a hasty LGTM might not be the best move, and here's why..

`[pause]`

**NATE**: First off, you're missing out on a golden opportunity to help your teammates grow. I mean, no code is perfect. Even if it does the job, it’s usually possible to make it cleaner, more efficient, or just easier to understand. When you say LGTM without giving any feedback, you're essentially hitting the brakes on progress.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Next up is 'code culture.' We all write code, but each team does it in its own way, following certain rules, a certain style. It's a bit like music - every band has its own sound. So when you say 'looks good to me,' without checking if the new piece fits the team's rhythm, it can throw off your harmony.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: And don't get me started on testing. We've all had the 'but it worked on my machine' moment. I get it, testing can feel like a drag. But giving a quick LGTM without testing is like buying a car without a test drive - sure, it looks good in the showroom, but maybe the windows like to roll themselves down when you turn on the wipers. Always buckle up and take it for a spin.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Finally, what about the poor soul who has to unpack this code in the future? Good code should do more than just work. It should lay down a clear path for others to follow. Each line of code, each comment, each function and variable should serve as a stepping stone. Writing clean, comprehensible code isn’t just best practice, it’s respecting your team.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: So before you drop that LGTM, take a moment to do a little digging, and give a little feedback. That's how you build great software.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Think about it over coffee, tea, water, whatever it is you do. But for now, that’s The Take. If you liked this episode, leave a reaction or comment below, I read every single one, and if you’re feeling particularly kind, hit that follow button. I feel every one of those, right here (fist over heart).

`[outro]`

**NATE**: I’m Nate Allen, and this has been The Take. Have a wonderful rest of your weekend. See you next time.
