**NATE**: Hey LinkedIn fam! I’m Nate Allen and this is The Take for Sunday September 3, 2023. Today, we're delving into the nuanced world of open source, and that delicate equilibrium between leveraging it and nurturing it.

**NATE**: Open source. It's like the public library of the tech world. But while many companies are avid "readers", not all are "authors" or even "librarians". And therein lies our challenge.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Picture open source as a communal garden. If everyone only picks the fruits but only a few water the plants or sow new seeds, eventually, the garden will wither. The same goes for open source. Without contributions, projects can lose momentum, and eventually, fade away.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: So if you're a business person, why should you care? And if you're a developer, why should you give back? Well for starters, it's about ensuring longevity. By actively participating, companies ensure that the tools they rely on remain vibrant and relevant.

**NATE**: Then there's the beauty of collective innovation. A diverse set of contributors often leads to richer, more versatile solutions. It's the magic of collective brainpower.

`[pause]`

And let's not forget the ethical angle. If you're building on open source, there's a sense of community duty to support and uplift the projects you rely on.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: But here's a reality check: not every project has the same impact. While the fall of a smaller project might not ripple through the entire community, it's a loss nonetheless. Smaller projects often cater to unique needs, and their absence can leave a void for those who relied on them.

**NATE**: Moreover, open source contributions can be a beacon for talent. Developers often gravitate towards companies that value and support open source, seeing them as forward-thinking and community-oriented.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: And there's a business angle too. By contributing to open source, companies can influence the direction of software development, ensuring it aligns with their needs and the needs of their customers.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Now, let's talk about the broader implications. When companies actively contribute to open source, it fosters a culture of collaboration and transparency. This not only benefits the tech community but also sets a precedent for other industries.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: It's not just about big code contributions. Think mentorship, funding, advocacy, or even just spreading the word. Every gesture counts.

`[pause]`

So, as you navigate open source, ask yourself this question: "Am I merely benefiting from the ecosystem, or am I actively contributing to its growth and sustainability?"

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Open source isn't just about free access; it's about shared responsibility. It's a dance of give and take, and for the rhythm to be right, we all need to find our steps.

**NATE**: I’m Nate Allen, and this has been The Take, reminding you to be both a user and a contributor. Have a wonderful rest of your weekend. See you next time.
