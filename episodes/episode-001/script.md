`[intro]`

**NATE**: Hey LinkedIn fam! I’m Nate Allen and this is The Take for June 28, 2023.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: This saying is born of long experience that if one release all week is going to break, it'll be the one someone rushed out on friday ;) No matter how you slice it, pushing new code always has a level of risk.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: A sort of gold-plated ideal of CI/CD is the ability to push to prod any time. It's important that engineering *have the confidence that they could push to prod any time*, but less important to actually do so.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: The reality is users don't care if you don't push to prod every day; and in most cases they won't even know or care if you release on a slower cadence. Also you often have marketing/support/product management reasons to choose exactly when and how often to release new features to customers. Your support team will not thank you for releasing new features during their busiest period of the week; and marketing won't be happy if you release something right after they've done the weekly email without mentioning it.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: I suspect many companies hit this balance:

- push to UAT on every green build
- ensure the codebase *can* be pushed to prod at any time (eg. for hotfixes)
- actually push to prod on a much slower cadence, accounting for business needs, at the highest rate that actually provides some value to users
- and/or you might use feature flags for greater control over deployment vs release

`[pause]`

**NATE**: So, am I *afraid* to push on fridays? No. Would I *choose* to push on fridays without a compelling reason? No.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Think about it over coffee, tea, water, whatever it is you do. But for now, that’s The Take. If you liked this episode, leave a reaction or comment below, I read every single one, and if you’re feeling particularly kind, hit that follow button. I feel every one of those, right here.

`[outro]`

**NATE**: I’m Nate Allen, and this has been The Take. Have a wonderful rest of your push-free Friday. See you next time.
