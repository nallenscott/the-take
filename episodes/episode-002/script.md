**NATE**: Hey LinkedIn fam! I’m Nate Allen and this is The Take for June 28, 2023.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Have you ever noticed how some leaders just seem to roll with the punches? I've been really struck lately by the power of transformational leaders, who don't just react to new trends and tech - they're ahead of the curve, always looking for ways to shape the future, not just adjust to it.

**NATE**: What gets me is how they manage to make their teams feel capable of reaching new heights, breaking through barriers they didn't even think they could. It's like they breathe this incredible energy into their organizations that drives everyone to keep learning, to bounce back stronger when things don't go to plan, and to adapt and evolve amidst all the chaos.

**NATE**: It's the kind of leadership that looks beyond the shiny veneer of innovation, and focuses on sustainable growth, inclusivity, and ethics, understanding that technology isn't just about flashy UIs or complex algorithms. It's about how these tools enhance human life, alleviate social challenges, and drive progress that benefits everyone.

**NATE**: It’s a brand of leadership that, in my opinion, embodies the true spirit of the tech industry - curiosity tempered with responsibility, ambition balanced by empathy, and a relentless pursuit of the future, firmly rooted in an understanding of our collective past and present. That’s the kind of leadership we need to guide us through the rollercoaster ride of this digital theme park we call tech.
