**NATE**: Hey LinkedIn fam! I’m Nate Allen and this is The Take for June 28, 2023.

**NATE**: "You may have noticed that we missed an episode last week. I took some time for self-reflection, a moment that cascaded over the entire weekend. It was a profound experience that inspired today's topic: finding purpose and self-worth in our careers as software engineers.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "It's easy to get lost in the sea of code, algorithms, and endless debugging. We often measure our worth by the lines of code we write, the efficiency of our algorithms, or the number of bugs we squash. But is that all there is to it? Is our value as software engineers solely determined by these metrics?

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "The answer is a resounding 'No'. Our worth is not just about the code we write or the products we build. It's about the impact we make, the problems we solve, and the lives we touch through our work. It's about using our skills to make a difference, whether it's building an app that helps people manage their health, or creating a platform that connects people across the globe.

**NATE**: "Finding our purpose is a journey that starts with self-reflection, just like the one I had last weekend. It's about asking ourselves, 'What kind of impact do I want to make?' and 'How can I use my skills to contribute to that?' It's about finding that intersection between what we're good at, what we love, and what the world needs.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "And remember, it's okay to not have all the answers right now. It's okay to explore, to try different things, to fail and learn from it. That's all part of the journey.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "As for self-worth, it's crucial to remember that your value is not determined by your job title, your salary, or how many hours you work. Your worth is inherent. It's about who you are as a person, not just what you do as a software engineer.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others, especially in this age of social media where everyone's achievements are on display. But remember, your journey is unique to you. Your worth is not defined by someone else's journey or success.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "So, take a moment to reflect. What drives you? What impact do you want to make? And remember, you are more than just a software engineer. You are a problem solver, a creator, and a change-maker.

**NATE**: Think about it over coffee, tea, water, whatever it is you do. But for now, that’s The Take. If you liked this episode, leave a reaction or comment below, I read every single one, and if you’re feeling particularly kind, hit that follow button. I feel every one of those, right here.
