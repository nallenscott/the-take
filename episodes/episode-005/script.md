`[intro]`

**NATE**: Hey LinkedIn fam! I’m Nate Allen and this is The Take for June 28, 2023.

**NATE**: "Imagine this - you've discovered a job opening that seems like a perfect fit. Excited, you quickly tailor your resume, craft a compelling cover letter, and hit that 'submit' button. And then, the waiting begins. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, with no response. The deafening silence is perhaps one of the most disheartening aspects of the job hunt."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "You might wonder, 'What's taking so long?' Well, recruiters are often juggling several roles at once, dealing with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of applicants. But in this era of technology, could we not employ automation to at least acknowledge application receipt? It's a small step, but it could change the game for many anxious candidates."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "Let's move on to another common scenario. You've successfully uploaded your meticulously crafted resume, only to be faced with another form asking for the exact same information. We'll call this the 'Redundant Info Syndrome'."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "You're essentially required to regurgitate everything that's already on your resume. This isn't just time-consuming; it's also incredibly frustrating. With AI and machine learning advancing by leaps and bounds, couldn't we innovate a solution here? A system that parses resumes and fills in the blanks could be a real game-changer."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "Next up, the infamous 'rejection ghosting'. You've invested time and effort into your application, tailored it to the role and the company. But, in return, you either get radio silence or the generic 'we've decided to go with other candidates'. Now, how can an employer determine if someone is a good 'fit' based solely on their resume?"

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "Some level of interaction, a screening call perhaps, offers a chance to evaluate the candidate beyond what's written on paper. Skills can be learned, but culture fit, work ethic, passion - these can't be gauged from a resume. A little transparency and communication can make a world of difference."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "Finally, let's address the elephant in the room - take-home assignments. On one hand, they offer an opportunity to showcase your skills in a real-world context. On the other, these tasks often morph into mini projects, demanding hours, if not days, of unpaid work."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "It's about striking a balance. Testing skills? Absolutely. But requiring extensive, unpaid work with no guarantee of progression? That's where we might need to draw the line."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "So, the tech hiring process isn't perfect - it's a maze, it's complex, and it's often demotivating. But it's not beyond repair. It needs attention, conversation, and innovative thinking. Let’s start the conversation right here on LinkedIn."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: "Share your experiences with the tech hiring process. What are your pet peeves? What changes do you want to see? Let's work together to rewrite the narrative."

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Think about it over coffee, tea, water, whatever it is you do. But for now, that’s The Take. If you liked this episode, leave a reaction or comment below, I read every single one, and if you’re feeling particularly kind, hit that follow button.
