`[intro]`

**NATE**: Hey LinkedIn fam! I’m Nate Allen and this is The Take for Sunday September 17, 2023. Today we're talking about casing – not the kind you find around a sausage, the naming conventions we use in our code. Let's get into it.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Now, for those who might be scratching their heads, casing refers to the way we write variable, function, and class names in code. It's the difference between myVariableName, MyVariableName, and my_variable_name.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: So why does this matter? Well, consistency in naming conventions can make code more readable and maintainable. Imagine reading a book where the capitalization and punctuation change every few sentences. It'd be jarring, right? The same goes for code.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: There are a few popular casing conventions to think about:

`[pause]`

1. **camelCase**: Where the first word starts with a lowercase letter, and each subsequent word is capitalized. Like thisIsCamelCase.

`[pause]`

2. **PascalCase**: Similar to CamelCase, but the first word is also capitalized. So, ThisIsPascalCase.

`[pause]`

3. **snake_case**: Words are separated by underscores and everything is in lowercase. Like this_is_snake_case.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Different languages and frameworks have their own preferences. For instance, JavaScript developers might lean towards camelCase, while Python developers often prefer snake_case.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: But here's the itch in my brain: Is one really better than the other? Well, no. It's more about consistency within a project or team. If everyone's on the same page, it's easier to parse and understand the code.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: However, it's also a matter of context. In object-oriented programming, it's common to use PascalCase for class names and CamelCase for method and variable names. This subtle distinction can provide immediate context about what a piece of code is doing.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Another interesting point is how casing can reflect the culture or history of a programming language. For instance, the preference for snake_case in Python can be traced back to its emphasis on readability and the Zen of Python's "Readability counts" mantra.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: At the end of the day, pick a convention that creates the least friction. Meaning it's commonly accepted for the domain, is easy to convert to, from, between, yada, yada, then stop worrying about it and focus on value logic.

`[pause]`

**NATE**: Remember, coding is as much an art as it is a science. The way we name things, the conventions we follow, they're all part of the craft. So, take pride in your work, and make it as clear and beautiful as you can.
